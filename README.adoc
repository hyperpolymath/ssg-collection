= SSG Collection
:toc: auto
:toclevels: 2

A consolidated monorepo of static site generator experiments and implementations from the hyperpolymath ecosystem.

*poly-ssg* (the main SSG framework) and *casket-ssg* (a distinct SSG framework) remain as separate repositories and are NOT included here.

== Origin

This monorepo was consolidated from 52 individual *-ssg repositories plus ssg-fixes on 2026-02-08 to reduce repository sprawl.
