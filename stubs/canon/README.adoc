**The formally specified functional generator in Standard ML.**
"Canon" — The law of the functional world. Stability over alpha.

== Who Is This For?
* **Functional Programming purists** who value the rigour of a formally defined language.
* **Systems Architects** requiring ultimate longevity and immutable semantics.
* **Teams** prioritising "Stability > Alpha" in their documentation pipelines.

== Why canon-ssg?
=== Mathematical Definition
Standard ML is legendary for having its semantics formally defined in a mathematical specification. In `canon-ssg`, your site logic is anchored in a language that does not change on a whim, ensuring your build process is reproducible for decades.

=== Milner-Grade Correctness
Following the discipline of Robin Milner, this engine provides high-integrity site synthesis. The strict module system and functional purity of SML prevent the "logic rot" common in less disciplined scripting environments.

=== Legacy Modernisation
While SML is a "classic" language, `canon-ssg` bridges this stability with modern **ReScript/Deno** orchestration and **Podman-first** deployment, offering the most stable core in the **poly-ssg** family.

== Quick Start
[source,oil]
----
# Bootstrap the SML environment (MLton or SML/NJ) via asdf
just setup

# Build the site using formally defined functional logic
just build

# Type-check the site structure
just check
----

== Features
* **Formally Defined Semantics** - Immutable build logic based on the SML '97 standard.
* **Strict Module System** - Clear separation of concerns for complex site architectures.
* **Podman-First** - Isolated runtimes for formally specified logic.
* **Accessibility** - Integrated support for **BSL**, **GSL**, **ASL**, and **Makaton**.

== Requirements
* **MLton** or **SML/NJ**
* **Just** (Orchestrator)

== Part of poly-ssg
`canon-ssg` is the formally specified functional member of the **poly-ssg** family.
