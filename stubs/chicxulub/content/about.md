# About chicxulub-ssg

chicxulub-ssg is part of the poly-ssg ecosystem, demonstrating static site generation in Bash.

## Why Bash?

Bash is universally available on Unix-like systems with zero dependencies to install. Its file manipulation primitives and piping philosophy make it natural for transforming content files. While unconventional for an SSG, Bash demonstrates that powerful tools can be built with the shell alone, and serves as a fallback when other runtimes are unavailable.
