== Who Is This For?

* **Forth programmers** who think in stacks
* **Embedded systems developers** wanting familiar tooling for docs
* **Minimalists** seeking zero-dependency solutions
* **Educators** teaching stack-based programming concepts

== Why estate-ssg?

=== Zero Dependencies

Just Forth. No package managers, no node_modules, no virtual environments. One file, infinite power.

=== Interactive Development

REPL-driven site building. See changes immediately. Test transformations word by word.

=== Concatenative Clarity

Content flows through the stack. Transformations compose naturally. No hidden state.

=== Tiny Binaries

Your site generator can fit on a floppy disk (with room to spare).
