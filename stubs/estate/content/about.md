# About estate-ssg

estate-ssg is part of the poly-ssg ecosystem, demonstrating static site generation in Eiffel.

## Why Eiffel?

Eiffel pioneered Design by Contract, where preconditions, postconditions, and class invariants are first-class language features. estate-ssg leverages these contracts to guarantee correctness in site generation - ensuring output HTML is valid and all links resolve.
