**Parallel-first static site generator in Chapel.**

Build sites at the speed of your CPU cores.

== Who Is This For?

* **Chapel developers** who appreciate data parallelism
* **HPC users** building documentation for supercomputers
* **Teams with massive site collections** - thousands of pages
* **Anyone whose builds take too long** on traditional SSGs

== Why parallax-ssg?

=== Parallel by Default

Every page builds in parallel automatically. Chapel's data parallelism means you write sequential-looking code that runs across all cores.

=== Scale to Any Size

10 pages or 100,000 pages - same code, linear scaling. Your build time is wall-clock time divided by cores.

=== Domain Map Support

Distribute builds across machines with Chapel's distributed arrays. Cluster-scale site generation.

=== First-Class Locales

Build different language versions in parallel on different locales. True polyglot site support.

== Quick Start

[source,chapel]
----
use Parallax;

config const srcDir = "content/",
             outDir = "public/";

proc main() {
  const pages = findPages(srcDir);
  forall page in pages do
    buildPage(page, outDir);
}
----

== Features

* **Automatic parallelization** - no manual threading
* **Distributed builds** - scale across machines
* **Locale-aware i18n** - parallel language builds
* **Zero copy transforms** - efficient memory usage
* **GPU offloading** - for image processing pipelines

== Requirements

* Chapel 1.30 or later

== Part of poly-ssg

parallax-ssg is part of the https://github.com/hyperpolymath/poly-ssg[poly-ssg] family, unified through https://github.com/hyperpolymath/poly-ssg-mcp[MCP integration].
