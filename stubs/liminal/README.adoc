**Time-reversible, structured site generation in Janus.**
"January" — Named for the two-faced god who looks simultaneously into the past and the future. A generator where every build is a mathematically invertible transformation.

== Who Is This For?
* **Reversible Computing Researchers** seeking a structured, imperative approach to zero-entropy site synthesis.
* **Systems Engineers** targeting **ASICs** and **Edge tech** where thermal management and energy conservation are primary constraints.
* **Formal Verification Purists** who require the ability to "un-build" a site to verify the absolute integrity of the source data.

== Why january-ssg?

=== Deterministic Invertibility
Janus is a structured imperative language where every statement has a unique inverse. In `january-ssg`, site generation is a reversible process; you can "uncall" the build procedure to revert to the exact source state with mathematical certainty.

=== Thermodynamic Minimalism
By avoiding the erasure of information, reversible computing circumvents the Landauer limit of energy dissipation. This makes `january-ssg` the most ecologically sound and heat-efficient engine in the **poly-ssg** family.

=== Peer of undo-ssg
While `undo-ssg` leverages the Arrow paradigm, `january-ssg` provides a familiar imperative structure (loops, conditionals) that remains strictly reversible. It serves as the "structured" anchor for the reversible tier of the ecosystem.

=== Podman-First "Time-Capsule"
The Janus runtime is fully containerised. Whether deploying to **Minix**, **Linux**, or **PC**, the reversible environment is isolated, ensuring that "undoing" a build never affects the host system's stability.

== Quick Start
[source,oil]
----
# Bootstrap the Janus environment via asdf
just setup

# Execute the site build (Forward transformation)
just build-forward

# Reverse the transformation to recover source state
just build-backward
----

== Features
* **Invertible Site Synthesis** - Forward and backward build paths are equally valid.
* **Information Preservation** - Zero loss of source data during the rendering pipeline.
* **Multi-Arch Support** - Optimized for **Minix**, **iOS**, **Android**, and **Edge** hardware.
* **Accessibility** - Integrated support for **BSL**, **GSL**, **ASL**, and **Makaton** metadata.

== Requirements
* **Janus Interpreter** (Academic/FOSS implementation)
* **Deno** (for ReScript/MCP adapters)
* **Just** (Orchestrator)

== Part of poly-ssg
`january-ssg` is the reversible, structured member of the **poly-ssg** family, unified through **MCP** integration.
