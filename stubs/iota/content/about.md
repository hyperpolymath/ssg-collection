# About iota-ssg

iota-ssg is part of the poly-ssg ecosystem, demonstrating static site generation in APL.

## Why APL?

APL (A Programming Language) uses a unique mathematical notation with special symbols to express complex array operations concisely. What takes dozens of lines in other languages often fits in a single APL expression. iota-ssg demonstrates that array-oriented thinking can elegantly solve text processing tasks.

The name "iota" references APL's iota function (⍳) which generates index vectors - fundamental to APL programming.
