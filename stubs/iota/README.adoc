**Array-oriented static site generator in APL.**
"iota" (⍳) — The generator of indices. A site engine where content is a vector and transformations are pure array-logic.

== Who Is This For?
* **APL/Dyalog developers** who treat content as high-dimensional data.
* **Systems Engineers** deploying to **Minix**, **ASICs**, or **Edge tech** where binary size and execution speed are critical.
* **Architects** needing to bridge legacy array-logic with modern **ReScript/Deno** orchestration via MCP.

== Why iota-ssg?

=== Array-Oriented Templates
Your templates are not string interpolations; they are functions mapped across content arrays. By leveraging `⍳`, `iota-ssg` generates site structures with $O(1)$ index-based access.

=== Massive Parallelism
Because APL operations are inherently vectorised, `iota-ssg` synthesises thousands of pages simultaneously. It is the fastest engine in the `poly-ssg` family for high-volume documentation.

=== Rank-Based Routing
Define your site hierarchy through array rank. Nested folders are simply higher-rank dimensions in your content matrix. No more recursive file-system crawls.

=== Zero-Overhead Metadata
Frontmatter is parsed into typed arrays. Use **Nickel** to define the schema, and `iota-ssg` will ensure your site shape matches your data shape at compile-time.

== Quick Start
[source,oil]
----
# Install via asdf
asdf install iota-ssg latest

# Create a site (Uses ReScript/Deno wrapper)
just init my-array-site

# Build with APL core (Defaults to Podman)
just build

# Type-check without building
just check
----

== Features
* **Vectorised Site Logic** - High-throughput generation via array-logic core.
* **ReScript Bridge** - Safe, functional interface for **Deno** and **MCP** consumers.
* **Podman-First** - Containerised builds for **Linux**, **Minix**, and **PC**.
* **Accessibility** - Native metadata for **BSL**, **GSL**, **ASL**, and **Makaton**.

== Requirements
* **Dyalog APL** or **GNU APL**
* **Deno** (for ReScript adapters)
* **Just** (for task orchestration)

== Part of poly-ssg
`iota-ssg` is part of the **poly-ssg** family of language-native static site generators, unified through MCP integration.
