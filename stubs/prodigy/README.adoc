**Logic-based static site generator in Prolog.**

Describe your site. Let the engine figure out the rest.

== Who Is This For?

* **Prolog developers** who think in relations
* **Logic programming enthusiasts** from any background
* **Content architects** with complex relationship requirements
* **Anyone tired** of imperative build scripts

== Why prodigy-ssg?

=== Declarative Site Definition

State facts about your content and relationships. Prolog infers the structure.

[source,prolog]
----
page(index, "Welcome").
page(about, "About Us").
links_to(index, about).
% Site structure is inferred
----

=== Backtracking Builds

Explore multiple build strategies automatically. The first valid solution wins.

=== Pattern Matching Templates

Templates are predicates. Pattern matching is native.

=== Query Your Site

Ask questions about your content before building.

[source,prolog]
----
?- page(X, _), \+ linked_from(_, X).
% Find orphan pages
----

== Quick Start

[source,prolog]
----
:- use_module(prodigy).

% Define your site
page(index, "Home", "Welcome to my site").
page(blog, "Blog", "My thoughts").
template(page, "templates/page.html").

% Build
?- build_site("output/").
----

== Features

* **Relational content model** - natural for complex sites
* **Constraint solving** - enforce content rules
* **Incremental inference** - only rebuild what changed
* **Meta-programming** - templates that write templates
* **DCG for HTML** - grammars for markup

== Requirements

* SWI-Prolog 8.0 or later
