# About prodigy-ssg

prodigy-ssg is part of the poly-ssg ecosystem, demonstrating static site generation in Prolog.

## Why Prolog?

Prolog's declarative nature makes it uniquely suited for describing document transformations as logical rules. Pattern matching on document structures feels natural, and Prolog's backtracking can elegantly handle template inheritance and conditional content. DCG (Definite Clause Grammars) provide a powerful way to parse and generate markup.
