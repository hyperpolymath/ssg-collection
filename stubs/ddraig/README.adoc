== Who Is This For?

* **Idris 2 developers** who want type-safe web content
* **Type theory researchers** exploring practical dependent types
* **Teams requiring provable correctness** in their build pipelines
* **Anyone frustrated** by template errors discovered in production

== Why ddraig-ssg?

=== Dependent Types for Templates

Your templates carry their structure in their types. A template expecting a `Post` cannot receive a `Page`. The compiler enforces it.

=== Totality Checking

Prove your templates are total - they handle all possible inputs. No more partial functions silently failing.

=== First-Class Schema Enforcement

Frontmatter schemas are types. Invalid frontmatter doesn't compile. Type errors tell you exactly what's wrong.

=== Refinement Types

Constrain your content with precision. A `NonEmpty String` title can never be empty. A `ValidURL` is always valid.

== Quick Start

[source,bash]
----
# Install
pack install ddraig-ssg

# Create a site
ddraig init my-site
cd my-site

# Build
ddraig build

# Type-check without building
ddraig check
----

== Features

* **Total template functions** - all inputs handled, no runtime errors
* **Dependent frontmatter types** - schemas as types, not runtime checks
* **Proof-carrying links** - internal links verified at compile time
* **Effect tracking** - IO separated from pure transformations
* **Quantitative types** - track resource usage in templates

== Requirements

* Idris 2 (0.6.0 or later)
* Pack package manager

== Part of poly-ssg

ddraig-ssg is part of the https://github.com/hyperpolymath/poly-ssg[poly-ssg] family of language-native static site generators, unified through https://github.com/hyperpolymath/poly-ssg-mcp[MCP integration].
