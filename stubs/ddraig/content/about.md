# About ddraig-ssg

ddraig-ssg is part of the poly-ssg ecosystem, demonstrating static site generation in Idris 2.

## Why Idris 2?

Idris 2 is a dependently-typed programming language that allows types to be predicated on values. This enables compile-time verification of properties that other languages can only check at runtime. ddraig-ssg explores how dependent types can make static site generation provably correct.

The name "ddraig" means "dragon" in Welsh, honoring the language's creator Edwin Brady and the powerful type system.
