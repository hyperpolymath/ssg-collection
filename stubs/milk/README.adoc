**Esoteric static site generator in COW.**

Proving Turing-completeness can be entertaining. Moo.

== Who Is This For?

* **Esoteric language enthusiasts** who appreciate the absurd
* **Computer science educators** demonstrating universality
* **Anyone with a sense of humor** about their tooling
* **People who want to prove a point** about language capability

== Why milk-ssg?

=== Because We Can

If it's Turing-complete, it can build a website. Yes, even COW. This SSG moos its way through your content.

=== Educational Value

Understanding how a Brainfuck variant can generate HTML teaches more about computation than any textbook.

=== Conversation Starter

"What's your tech stack?" "COW." "...like, the animal?" "Exactly."

=== Minimal Syntax

Twelve commands. That's it. No keywords to memorize, no syntax to debate. Just variations of "moo."

== COW Commands

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| moo | Skip next if register = 0
| mOo | Move pointer back
| moO | Move pointer forward
| mOO | Execute memory as instruction
| Moo | Print char or read input
| MOo | Decrement
| MoO | Increment
| MOO | Loop end
| OOO | Zero memory
| MMM | Copy register
| OOM | Print as integer
| oom | Read integer
|===

== Quick Start

[source,bash]
----
# Run with a COW interpreter
cow src/milk-ssg.cow

# Or use the bundled interpreter
./run-cow.sh src/milk-ssg.cow
----
