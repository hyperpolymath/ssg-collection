# About shift-ssg

shift-ssg is part of the poly-ssg ecosystem, demonstrating static site generation in Wren.

## Why Wren?

Wren is a small, fast, class-based scripting language designed for embedding. Its clean syntax inspired by Lua and Smalltalk makes it readable and expressive. Wren's fiber-based concurrency model offers interesting possibilities for parallel content processing during site builds.
