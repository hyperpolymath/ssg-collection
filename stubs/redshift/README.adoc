**Full-stack, reactive static site generation in RED.**
"Shift" — Shifting paradigms between high-level logic and low-level performance. A generator built on the "Red" philosophy of total freedom and dialecting.

== Who Is This For?
* **Full-stack developers** who want a single language to handle both build logic and reactive TUIs.
* **Systems Engineers** targeting **Minix**, **Android**, or **PC** who need tiny, single-file binaries.
* **Minimalists** who value the "Rebol-style" dialecting power for custom site schemas.

== Why shift-ssg?

=== Dialected Site Logic
RED’s greatest power is its ability to create Domain Specific Languages (DSLs). `shift-ssg` uses a custom "Site-Dialect" that allows you to describe site architecture in a way that is readable to humans and executable by the machine.

=== Red/System Performance
While the high-level logic is handled in RED, the heavy lifting (file I/O, string processing) is shifted to **Red/System**—a C-level dialect—ensuring near-native performance without external dependencies.

=== Reactive Build Engine
`shift-ssg` includes a built-in reactive TUI for monitoring builds. As you edit content, the engine "shifts" the delta into the rendered output in real-time, providing instant feedback.

=== Single-File Portability
The entire generator compiles into a tiny, standalone binary (approx. 1MB). This makes it the most portable engine in the fleet, easily deployed to constrained **Edge tech** or **Minix** environments.

== Quick Start
[source,oil]
----
# Download the RED toolchain
just setup

# Compile the SSG core to a native binary
just compile

# Run the reactive build process
just build
----

== Features
* **Dialect-Driven Templates** - Custom SSG grammar for content synthesis.
* **Zero Dependencies** - Single-file binaries for all major platforms.
* **Podman-First** - Standard containerised build environments.
* **Accessibility** - Integrated support for **BSL**, **GSL**, and **Makaton**.

== Requirements
* **RED Toolchain (Latest Stable)**
* **Just** (Orchestrator)

== Part of poly-ssg
`shift-ssg` is the full-stack, paradigm-shifting member of the **poly-ssg** family.
