# About terrapin-ssg

terrapin-ssg is part of the poly-ssg ecosystem, demonstrating static site generation in Logo.

## Why Logo?

Logo is a historically significant educational programming language known for its turtle graphics. While primarily used for teaching, Logo's Lisp heritage gives it powerful list processing capabilities that translate well to working with content hierarchies and site structures. terrapin-ssg explores how this classic language can tackle modern web generation tasks.
