# About anvil-ssg

anvil-ssg is part of the poly-ssg ecosystem, demonstrating static site generation in Ada with SPARK formal verification.

## Why Ada/SPARK?

Ada is a statically typed, high-integrity language designed for safety-critical systems. SPARK extends Ada with formal verification capabilities, allowing mathematical proof of program correctness. anvil-ssg demonstrates that web tooling can benefit from the same rigor applied to aerospace and medical software, producing provably correct static sites.
