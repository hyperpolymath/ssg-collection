## CRITICAL: Language Immutability

⚠️ **DO NOT CHANGE THE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE OF THIS REPOSITORY**

This repository is written in **Ada/SPARK** as stated in the README description.
- The implementation language MUST remain Ada/SPARK
- Do NOT port, rewrite, or translate to other languages
- Do NOT change the repository description or tagline
- The language is a fundamental architectural decision

## Repository Focus
- `cloudanvil-ssg` is a Rhodium Standard Repository; obey the Rhodium policies, maintain `.bot_directives`, and keep `.machine_readable/` authoritative.
- Prefer to keep generated files out of source control, and regenerate them with the documented commands before committing.

## Workflow
1. Inspect `.machines_readable/6scm/STATE.scm` for blockers and next actions.
2. Respect any constraints listed inside `.machines_readable/6scm/AGENTIC.scm` when tooling changes are requested.
3. After finishing edits, update STATE with your outcomes and commit with a concise, imperative message.

## Delivery Promises
- Mention in summaries whether STATE, `contractiles/`, or `.bot_directives/` changed.
- Keep this file in sync with the repository’s status; update it if the governance changes.
