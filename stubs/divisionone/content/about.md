# About divisionone-ssg

divisionone-ssg is part of the poly-ssg ecosystem, demonstrating static site generation in COBOL.

## Why COBOL?

COBOL proves that even a 65-year-old language can build modern web tooling. Its verbose, self-documenting syntax and exceptional string handling capabilities (developed for business report generation) translate surprisingly well to document processing. divisionone-ssg is both a functional tool and a statement that no language is obsolete if it can solve the problem.
