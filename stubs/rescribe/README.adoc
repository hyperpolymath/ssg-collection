**Type-safe static site generator in ReScript.**

ML-family types meet the JavaScript ecosystem.

== Who Is This For?

* **ReScript developers** who love the language
* **Former BuckleScript users** seeking modern tooling
* **Teams wanting type safety** without leaving the JS ecosystem
* **Anyone frustrated** by runtime type errors in Node SSGs

== Why rescribe-ssg?

=== ML-Family Type Inference

Write code naturally. Types are inferred. Errors are caught at compile time.

[source,rescript]
----
let buildPage = (page: page) => {
  let html = page.content->Markdown.toHtml
  html->Template.apply(page.frontmatter)
}
// Types inferred, errors caught
----

=== Readable JavaScript Output

The generated JavaScript is readable and debuggable. No runtime overhead from the type system.

=== Full JS Ecosystem Access

npm packages work seamlessly. Bindings are type-safe. Best of both worlds.

=== Pattern Matching for Content

Variant types and pattern matching make content handling elegant.

== Quick Start

[source,bash]
----
# Install
npm install -g rescribe-ssg

# Create a site
rescribe init my-site
cd my-site

# Build
rescribe build

# Watch mode
rescribe watch
----

== Features

* **Sound type system** - if it compiles, it works
* **Variant types** - model content precisely
* **Pattern matching** - elegant content handling
* **Fast compilation** - sub-second rebuilds
* **npm compatibility** - use any JS library

== Requirements

* Node.js 18 or later
* ReScript 11+
