## CRITICAL: Language Immutability

⚠️ **DO NOT CHANGE THE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE OF THIS REPOSITORY**

This repository implements **Note G** - an esoteric language based on Ada Lovelace's 1843 algorithm.
- The implementation language MUST remain Note G esolang
- Do NOT port to Ada (programming language), Python, JavaScript, or any other language
- Do NOT change the repository description or historical context
- Note G is the first published algorithm in history - this is a tribute to that legacy
- The language and historical fidelity are fundamental to the project's purpose

## Repository Focus
- `noteg-ssg` is a Rhodium Standard Repository; obey the Rhodium policies and keep `.machine_readable/` authoritative.
- Prefer to keep generated files out of source control, and regenerate them with the documented commands before committing.

## Workflow
1. Inspect `STATE.scm` for blockers and next actions.
2. Respect any constraints listed inside `AGENTIC.scm` when tooling changes are requested.
3. After finishing edits, update STATE with your outcomes and commit with a concise, imperative message.

## Delivery Promises
- Mention in summaries whether STATE, `contractiles/`, or `.bot_directives/` changed.
- Keep this file in sync with the repository's status; update it if the governance changes.
