# Welcome to Forth Estate

This is the first post generated by **Forth Estate**, a stack-based static site generator written in Forth.

## Why Forth?

Forth offers a unique perspective on computation:

- **Stack-based**: Data flows naturally through transformations
- **Concatenative**: Words compose like Unix pipes
- **Minimal**: The entire SSG fits in a single file
- **Educational**: See how a different paradigm solves familiar problems

## Features

Fourth Estate supports:

1. YAML frontmatter parsing
2. Markdown to HTML conversion
3. Template substitution
4. Code blocks with syntax preservation

```forth
: hello ( -- )
  ." Hello from Forth Estate!" cr ;
```

## Philosophy

> "The stack is not a limitation. It's a way of thinking."

Each word transforms the stack. Data flows through. No variables needed (though available when clarity demands).
