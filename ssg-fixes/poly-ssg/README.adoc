_One contract. Many paradigms. Every paradigm teaches._

A polyglot static site generator framework where each engine embodies its language's philosophy—from dependently-typed correctness to stack-based minimalism—unified through a common MCP interface.

== Who Is This For?

* **Paradigm explorers** — See the same problem solved through functional, logic, parallel, and stack-based lenses
* **Language enthusiasts** — Each engine is idiomatic, not a transliteration
* **MCP practitioners** — Switch between engines without changing your tooling
* **Educators** — Demonstrate that there's no "one true way" to generate sites

== Why poly-ssg?

=== Paradigm Purity

Each engine embraces its language's strengths. Haskell stays pure. Prolog stays declarative. Forth stays stack-oriented. No lowest-common-denominator compromises.

=== One Contract, Many Implementations

The MCP contract defines _what_ an SSG does. Each engine decides _how_. Your AI assistant, build scripts, and workflows remain unchanged when you switch paradigms.

=== Educational by Design

Static site generation is complex enough to be interesting, simple enough to understand. Comparing implementations reveals:

* Trade-offs between approaches
* Language idioms through real examples
* Why certain paradigms excel at certain tasks

=== Production-Ready Satellites

Each engine is a standalone project. Use Casket (Haskell) in production while exploring Ddraig (Idris 2) for provable correctness. They share a contract, not a codebase.

== Engines

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Engine |Language |Paradigmatic Strength

|**Casket**
|Haskell
|Pure functional transformations, lazy evaluation

|**Ddraig**
|Idris 2
|Dependently-typed, compile-time correctness proofs

|**Estate**
|Forth
|Stack-based, minimal dependencies, concatenative composition

|**Parallax**
|Chapel
|Data-parallel, scales to thousands of pages without threading pain

|**Prodigy**
|Prolog
|Logic-based, declarative site definitions as rules

|**Rescribe**
|ReScript
|Type-safe compilation to JavaScript, fast iteration

|**Zigzag**
|Zig
|Zero-overhead abstractions, explicit memory control
|===

Additional experimental engines exist for COW, Logo, WebAssembly Text, and Conway's Game of Life—proving computational universality extends to static site generation.

== Quick Start

Each engine is a satellite repository. To use one:

[source,bash]
----
# Clone the engine you want
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/casket-ssg

# Or use via the unified MCP interface
# (poly-ssg-mcp exposes all engines through a single server)
----
