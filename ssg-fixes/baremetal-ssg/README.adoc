**Hardware-native static site generation in RISC-V Assembly.**
"Baremetal" — No OS, no runtime, no abstractions. A generator that treats site synthesis as a formal sequence of register-level operations.

== Who Is This For?
* **Firmware Engineers** targeting **ASICs** and **Edge tech** where every byte of overhead is a failure.
* **Low-level purists** who want to generate site content directly from bootloaders or custom silicon.
* **Systems Architects** requiring an engine that can run on a **RISC-V** soft-core within an FPGA without a kernel.
* **Security Researchers** needing a generator with a zero-syscall attack surface.

== Why baremetal-ssg?

=== Instruction-Level Synthesis
`baremetal-ssg` is written in pure RISC-V assembly (`rv64gc`). Site generation is reduced to a series of atomic memory moves and integer operations, bypassing the "bloat" of even the most efficient C compilers.

=== Zero-Syscall Architecture
Designed to run on the metal. It manages its own memory and I/O, making it the fastest possible generator for high-integrity **Edge** hardware where a kernel is an unnecessary security risk.

=== Register-Mapped Templates
Templates are not parsed; they are memory-mapped. By treating content as a series of offsets, `baremetal-ssg` achieves true $O(1)$ access times for site structure, limited only by hardware clock speed.

=== Formal Interrupt Logic
Build steps are triggered by hardware interrupts. This ensures that the generation process is perfectly timed and deterministic, making it ideal for safety-critical documentation displays on custom hardware.

== Quick Start
[source,oil]
----
# Assemble the core using the RISC-V toolchain via asdf
just setup

# Flash the generator logic to the target ASIC or Simulator
just flash

# Build the site directly on the hardware (Zero-OS mode)
just build-hardware
----

== Features
* **O(1) Memory Management** - Manual stack and heap control for absolute predictability.
* **Zero-Runtime Overhead** - No garbage collection, no heap-fragmentation, no hidden control flow.
* **Podman-First Simulation** - Test assembly logic in a QEMU-driven Podman container.
* **Accessibility** - Hardware-accelerated metadata tagging for **BSL**, **GSL**, and **Makaton**.

== Requirements
* **RISC-V GNU Toolchain** (rv64gc)
* **QEMU** (for simulation/testing)
* **Just** (Orchestrator)

== Part of poly-ssg
`baremetal-ssg` is the hardware-native cornerstone of the **poly-ssg** family.
