**High-integrity, safety-critical site generation in Ada/SPARK.**
"Anvil" — The iron-clad forge of correctness. A generator built for systems where a build failure is not just an error, but a safety risk.

== Who Is This For?
* **High-Integrity Systems Engineers** who demand mathematical proof of software correctness.
* **Aerospace and Medical Architects** requiring documentation tools that meet DO-178C or ISO 26262 standards.
* **Security Purists** who want to eliminate all categories of runtime errors through formal verification.

== Why anvil-ssg?

=== Formal Verification with SPARK
By using the **SPARK** subset of Ada, `anvil-ssg` provides mathematical proof that the generator is free from buffer overflows, division by zero, and uninitialised variables. It is the "Hardened Shield" of the **poly-ssg** family.

=== Design by Contract
Templates and content-loaders use strict preconditions and postconditions. The engine proves that if the input satisfies the contract, the output is guaranteed to be valid HTML/CSS, leaving no room for "heisenbugs."

=== Deterministic Resource Management
Ada's disciplined approach to memory ensures that `anvil-ssg` operates with a predictable footprint. This makes it the premier choice for **ASICs** and **Minix**-based systems where memory leaks are unacceptable.

=== Real-Time Build Monitoring
Leveraging Ada's tasking model, the generator provides real-time, deterministic feedback on the build state, allowing for high-integrity monitoring in safety-critical environments.

== Quick Start
[source,oil]
----
# Setup GNAT and SPARK tools via asdf
just setup

# Run the SPARK prover to verify the site logic
just prove

# Compile the verified SSG core
just build
----

== Features
* **Formally Proven Core** - Zero runtime errors via GNATprove.
* **Strong Typing Discipline** - Total separation of content and presentation types.
* **Podman-First** - Hardened build containers for high-integrity environments.
* **Multi-Arch** - Verified for **RISC-V**, **x86_64**, and **ARM**.

== Requirements
* **GNAT (Ada 2022)**
* **SPARK Prover**
* **Just** (Orchestrator)

== Part of poly-ssg
`anvil-ssg` is the high-integrity safety member of the **poly-ssg** family.
