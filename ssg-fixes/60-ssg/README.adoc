**The foundational block-structured generator in ALGOL 60.**
"60" — The standard of algorithmic publication. Pure, block-structured site synthesis.

== Who Is This For?
* **Computer Science purists** who value the "Latin" of structured programming.
* **Systems Architects** requiring rigid, block-scoped build logic.
* **Historians and Researchers** exploring the origins of lexical scope in site generation.

== Why 60-ssg?
=== Lexical Scope Rigour
ALGOL 60 introduced the code block (`begin`...`end`). In `60-ssg`, site variables are strictly scoped to their blocks, preventing the global-state corruption common in modern scripting engines.

=== Algorithmic Clarity
Used as the standard for algorithm publication for decades, this engine provides a level of readability and discipline that prioritises stability over alpha features.

== Quick Start
[source,oil]
----
# Prepare the ALGOL 60 environment via asdf
just setup

# Build the site using block-structured logic
just build
----

== Features
* **Strict Block Scoping** - Variables restricted to local execution units.
* **Podman-First** - Isolated runtimes for legacy block-logic.
* **Accessibility** - Integrated support for **BSL**, **GSL**, and **Makaton**.

== Requirements
* **ALGOL 60 Interpreter**
* **Just** (Orchestrator)

== Part of poly-ssg
`60-ssg` is the block-structured ancestor of the **poly-ssg** family.
