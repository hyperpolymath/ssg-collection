**Live, object-oriented static site generation in Pharo.**
"Pharos" — A lighthouse in the sea of static files. A site engine where your content lives as a graph of interactive objects.

== Who Is This For?
* **Smalltalkers** who prefer a "live image" environment over a "edit-compile-run" cycle.
* **Architects** who view site structure as a dynamic object-graph rather than a file-tree.
* **Teams** needing a reflective, interactive build environment that persists state across sessions.

== Why pharos-ssg?
=== Live Image Synthesis
In `pharos-ssg`, the generator and the site content share the same memory space. Changes to a template are reflected instantly across the entire object-graph. You don't "run" a build; you "save" the state of the objects into HTML.

=== Fully Reflective Logic
The engine can inspect itself and your content at runtime. Use the Pharo inspector to navigate your site's hierarchy, find broken links, and refactor templates as live objects.

== Quick Start
[source,oil]
