# About Rats-SSG

Rats-SSG is part of the poly-ssg ecosystem, demonstrating static site generation in Ratfor.

## Why Ratfor?

Ratfor (Rational Fortran) is a preprocessor that adds structured programming constructs to Fortran. Created at Bell Labs alongside C, it represents an important step in programming language evolution. Rats-SSG is a nostalgic exploration of text processing using this historically significant language.
