# About QED-SSG

QED-SSG is part of the poly-ssg ecosystem, demonstrating static site generation in Lean 4.

## Why Lean 4?

Lean 4 is both a theorem prover and a general-purpose functional programming language. Its dependent type system can prove properties about code at compile time. QED-SSG explores how proof-carrying code can guarantee correctness of content transformations and output validity.
