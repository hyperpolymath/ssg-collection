**Cellular automaton static site generator in Conway's Game of Life.**

_Let patterns evolve. Let cells compute. Let pages emerge._

== The Language

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life[Conway's Game of Life] is a zero-player cellular automaton where simple rules produce unbounded complexity. In 1970, John Conway proved that four rules governing cell birth and death could simulate any computation—including building websites.

hackenbush-ssg takes this to its logical extreme: an SSG where the "source code" is a Life pattern. The pattern evolves. HTML emerges.

== Why Life?

=== Emergent Computation

No instructions exist. No control flow. Only cells following four rules:

* A live cell with 2-3 neighbors survives
* A dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes alive
* All other cells die or stay dead

From these rules, Turing-complete computation emerges. Glider guns become clocks. Eaters become memory. Collisions become logic gates.

=== Radical Minimalism

Most languages add features. Life has exactly one operation: the generation step. Every SSG behavior—parsing, templating, routing—must be encoded in cell configurations. There is no escape hatch.

=== Deterministic Purity

Given an initial pattern, the output is mathematically determined. No side effects. No randomness. No I/O during computation. The universe ticks forward; pages crystallize.

== For Whom?

* **Cellular automata researchers** exploring practical applications of Life
* **Theoretical computer scientists** interested in unconventional computation models
* **Mathematicians** drawn to Conway's legacy and combinatorial game theory
* **Adventurous engineers** who find "Turing-complete" an invitation, not a warning

The host runtime provides _only_ simulation and I/O. All SSG logic lives in the pattern.

== Usage

[source,bash]
----
# Evolve the pattern, emit HTML
deno run --allow-read --allow-write runtime/host.ts

# Custom pattern, generations, output
deno run --allow-read --allow-write runtime/host.ts src/hackenbush.rle 10000 _site/index.html

== Ecosystem

hackenbush-ssg integrates with https://github.com/hyperpolymath/poly-ssg-mcp[poly-ssg-mcp], which provides unified MCP tooling across 28 static site generators in 19 languages. The poly-mcp portfolio also includes https://github.com/hyperpolymath/poly-container-mcp[poly-container-mcp] and https://github.com/hyperpolymath/poly-iac-mcp[poly-iac-mcp].

== Namesake

Named for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackenbush[Hackenbush], another combinatorial game analyzed by John Conway. Both games share an elegant truth: simple rules yield infinite depth.
