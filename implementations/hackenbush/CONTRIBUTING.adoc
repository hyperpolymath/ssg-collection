Thank you for your interest in contributing to hackenbush-ssg! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

== Understanding the Project

hackenbush-ssg is an *experimental* static site generator where the core SSG logic is encoded in Conway's Game of Life patterns. This is not a conventional codebase.

=== Key Principle

**The Life pattern IS the program.** The host runtime provides ONLY simulation and I/O.

=== Project Structure

== What You Can Contribute

=== Life Patterns (Encouraged)

* New pattern components for computation
* Optimized versions of existing patterns
* Documentation of pattern behavior
* Pattern libraries for specific operations

=== Host Runtime (Limited)

The host runtime (`runtime/host.ts`) should ONLY be modified for:

* Bug fixes in the Life simulator
* Performance improvements to simulation
* I/O improvements (file reading/writing)
* Better RLE parsing

**NEVER** add SSG logic to the host runtime.

=== MCP Adapter (ReScript Only)

The MCP adapter must be written in ReScript. Contributions welcome for:

* Better poly-ssg hub integration
* Additional MCP capabilities
* Documentation improvements

=== Documentation

* README improvements
* Pattern documentation
* Usage examples
* Research notes on Life-based computation

== What NOT to Contribute

The following will be **rejected without discussion**:

* JavaScript/TypeScript SSG logic (use Life patterns instead)
* Python, Go, Ruby, or other conventional language implementations
* "Practical" rewrites that abandon the Life pattern approach
* HTML generation in the host runtime
* Markdown parsing in the host runtime
* Template processing in the host runtime

== Code of Conduct

* Be respectful and constructive
* Focus on technical merit
* Accept that this project has unusual constraints by design
* Understand that "impractical" is not a valid criticism - the project exists to prove a concept

== How to Submit

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Ensure CI passes (especially the Game of Life pattern validation)
5. Submit a pull request with clear description
