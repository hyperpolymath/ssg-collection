== How Patterns Work

=== Gliders as Signals

Gliders are the fundamental data carriers in Life patterns:

* Travel at c/4 (1 cell per 4 generations)
* Move diagonally
* Period 4 oscillation
* Can be created, destroyed, and detected

=== Logic Gates

Logic operations are implemented through glider collisions:

* **AND Gate**: Two glider streams collide; output only when both present
* **OR Gate**: Parallel paths merge; output when either stream present
* **NOT Gate**: Continuous gun + eater; input glider interrupts output
* **XOR Gate**: Complex collision pattern for exclusive or

=== Memory

Memory cells use still life patterns (blocks):

* Block present = 1
* Block absent = 0
* SET: Specific glider creates block
* CLEAR: Specific glider destroys block
* READ: Detection glider stream

== Contributing New Patterns

1. Design pattern in Golly or similar tool
2. Export as RLE format
3. Add to this directory
4. Document in this README
5. Add tests if applicable
