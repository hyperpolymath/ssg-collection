# About gungir-ssg

gungir-ssg is part of the poly-ssg ecosystem, demonstrating static site generation in ReScript.

## Why ReScript?

ReScript compiles to highly optimized JavaScript with a sound type system derived from OCaml. It offers the best of both worlds: ML-style pattern matching and type inference with seamless JavaScript interop. gungir-ssg showcases type-safe web tooling that runs anywhere JavaScript does.

The name "gungir" (Gungnir) references Odin's spear - always hitting its target, just like ReScript's type system catches errors before runtime.
