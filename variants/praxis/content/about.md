# About doit-ssg

doit-ssg is part of the poly-ssg ecosystem, demonstrating static site generation in Io.

## Why Io?

Io is a pure prototype-based object-oriented language inspired by Smalltalk, Self, and Lua. Its minimalist syntax (no keywords, just messages) and homoiconic nature make it highly expressive. Io's prototype system allows elegant modeling of content inheritance and template composition without traditional class hierarchies.
