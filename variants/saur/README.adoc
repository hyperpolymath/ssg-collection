**Modern, secure site generation in Deno.**
"Saur" — A resilient survivor. Leveraging the V8 sandbox for safe, high-speed site synthesis without the legacy of Node.js.

== Who Is This For?
* **Security-conscious developers** requiring "Zero-Trust" build environments where the engine is sandboxed by default.
* **ReScript/WASM practitioners** needing a native, modern runtime for functional adapters and orchestration.
* **Teams** looking for a built-in toolchain that includes testing, linting, and formatting without external dependencies.

== Why saur-ssg?

=== Permissions-First Security
`saur-ssg` leverages Deno’s security model. The generator has zero access to your file system or environment variables unless you explicitly grant it via the **Justfile**. This makes it the safest "glue" engine in the **poly-ssg** fleet.

=== First-Class WASM/ReScript
Designed to run your **ReScript**-generated logic and **WASM** modules natively on the V8 engine. It acts as the primary orchestrator for the **poly-ssg-mcp** hub, handling the complexity of network-based content fetching with modern `fetch` APIs.

=== Zero-Config Toolchain
No `package.json` or `node_modules` rot. `saur-ssg` is self-contained and prioritises **asdf** for version management, ensuring that your build pipeline is as "clean" as the sites it produces.

== Quick Start
[source,oil]
----
# Setup Deno via asdf
just setup

# Build the site with explicit permissions
just build --allow-read --allow-write

# Run the ReScript adapter tests
just test
