# About saur-ssg

saur-ssg is part of the poly-ssg ecosystem, demonstrating static site generation in Squirrel.

## Why Squirrel?

Squirrel is a lightweight, embeddable scripting language with a C-like syntax. Its small footprint and excellent embedding capabilities make it ideal for demonstrating how scripting languages can power static site generators. Squirrel's table-based data structures map naturally to site configuration and content metadata.
