**Consensus-driven static site generation in Raft (Rust).**
"consensus" — Site synthesis via distributed consensus. A generator where your content only builds when the cluster agrees on its state.

== Who Is This For?
* **Distributed Systems Engineers** who want their site to be a replicated state machine.
* **Architects** requiring high availability and total consistency in build logs.
* **Teams** deploying to **Edge tech** clusters where nodes must agree on the "Current Version" of truth.

== Why consensus-ssg?
=== Consensus-Based Synthesis
`consensus-ssg` uses the **Raft consensus algorithm** to manage the build. Instead of a single process rendering files, a cluster of nodes replicates the "Content Log." A build is only committed once a majority of nodes verify the transformation.

=== Fault-Tolerant Pipelines
If a build node fails during rendering, the Raft leader re-assigns the "term" to a follower. This ensures that the site generation process is resilient to hardware failure across your **Minix** or **Linux** cluster.

== Quick Start
[source,oil]
----
# Initialise the Raft cluster
just cluster-up

# Propose a content change to the leader
just propose "New Blog Post"

# Build once consensus is reached
just build
