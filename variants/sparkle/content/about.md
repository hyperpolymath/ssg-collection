# About sparkle-ssg

sparkle-ssg is part of the poly-ssg ecosystem, demonstrating static site generation in Gleam.

## Why Gleam?

Gleam combines the reliability of the BEAM (Erlang VM) with a friendly, type-safe syntax. Its ability to compile to both Erlang and JavaScript means sparkle-ssg can run on servers or in the browser. Gleam's emphasis on simplicity and helpful error messages makes it approachable while maintaining robustness.
