**Type-safe, concurrent static site generation in Gleam.**
"Sparkle" — The brilliant clarity of a type-safe BEAM. A generator that brings functional elegance and fault tolerance to your content pipeline.

== Who Is This For?
* **Erlang/Elixir developers** who want the static typing of ML on the BEAM.
* **Systems Architects** requiring high-concurrency builds with zero runtime exceptions.
* **Teams** seeking a modern, user-friendly functional engine that compiles to Erlang, JavaScript, or WASM.
* **Accessibility Advocates** requiring a concurrent engine that treats BSL/ASL metadata as first-class types.

== Why sparkle-ssg?

=== Type-Safe Concurrency
Gleam’s type system ensures that data flowing through your concurrent build processes is always valid. `sparkle-ssg` catches template logic errors at compile time, ensuring that the "actor" processes never crash due to unexpected data shapes.

=== Fault-Tolerant Pipelines
Built on the Erlang VM (BEAM), `sparkle-ssg` handles massive sites by distributing rendering tasks across light-weight processes. If a single page render fails, the supervisor restarts the task without interrupting the rest of the build.

=== Immutable Content Flows
Content transformations are pure functional pipelines. By leveraging Gleam's immutable data structures, `sparkle-ssg` guarantees that your site state is never corrupted by side effects during the synthesis process.

=== Multi-Target Emission
`sparkle-ssg` can compile to Erlang for high-performance server-side builds or to JavaScript/WASM for client-side or **Edge tech** execution, offering unparalleled deployment flexibility.

== Quick Start
[source,oil]
----
# Install Gleam and Erlang via asdf
just setup

# Build the site with BEAM-level concurrency
just build

# Generate a WASM target for Edge deployment
just build-wasm
----

== Features
* **Parallel Synthesis** - Native BEAM process management for multi-core scaling.
* **Strict Type Inference** - No more runtime errors in your template logic.
* **Podman-First** - Standard containerised toolchain for BEAM-based logic.
* **Accessibility** - Integrated support for **BSL**, **GSL**, **ASL**, and **Makaton**.

== Requirements
* **Gleam (1.4.0 or later)**
* **Erlang/OTP 26+**
* **Just** (Orchestrator)

== Part of poly-ssg
`sparkle-ssg` is the type-safe concurrent member of the **poly-ssg** family.
