= Lab Notebook Basic Example
:toc:

A minimal example demonstrating Lab Notebook's scientific publishing features.

== Prerequisites

- SciLab installed (`scilab-cli` command available)
- Lab Notebook source

== Building

```bash
# From the repository root
cd examples/basic

# Build this example (executes embedded SciLab code)
scilab-cli -f ../../src/labnote.sce -- build
```

== Structure

```
basic/
├── content/
│   └── index.md    # Markdown with embedded SciLab
├── _site/          # Generated HTML output (after build)
└── README.adoc     # This file
```

== Output

After building, `_site/index.html` contains:

- Frontmatter metadata (title, date)
- Markdown converted to HTML
- SciLab code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Executed SciLab results inline

== Features Demonstrated

|===
| Feature | Description

| Embedded Execution
| SciLab code blocks are executed during build

| Matrix Math
| Eigenvalue computation example

| Signal Processing
| Sinusoidal analysis demonstration

| Linear Regression
| Least squares fitting

| Reproducibility
| Same results on every build
|===

== How It Works

1. Parser identifies ```scilab code blocks
2. Code is executed via SciLab's `execstr()`
3. Output captured via `diary()` mechanism
4. Results rendered alongside the code
5. HTML generated with both code and output

== Scientific Applications

- Lab notebooks with computed results
- Teaching materials with live examples
- Research documentation with verification
- Experimental data analysis reports
