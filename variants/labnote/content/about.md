# About labnote-ssg

labnote-ssg is part of the poly-ssg ecosystem, demonstrating static site generation in Scilab.

## Why Scilab?

Scilab is an open-source numerical computation language, and using it for an SSG highlights its often-overlooked general-purpose scripting capabilities. For scientific blogs and lab notebooks, labnote-ssg can natively process data, generate plots, and embed computation results directly into pages. It bridges the gap between analysis and publication.
