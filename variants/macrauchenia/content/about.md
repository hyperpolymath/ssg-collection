# About macrauchenia-ssg

macrauchenia-ssg is part of the poly-ssg ecosystem, demonstrating static site generation in OCaml.

## Why OCaml?

OCaml offers a pragmatic blend of functional and imperative programming with an excellent type system. Its pattern matching is ideal for parsing document structures, and the compiler produces fast native binaries. The language has a strong tradition in document processing and tooling (e.g., Compcert, Coq).
